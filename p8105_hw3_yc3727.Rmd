### Problem 1

```{r}
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains `r nrow(instacart)` rows and ... columns. 
Observations are the level of items in orders by users. There are user/order variables -- user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There are also item variables -- name, aisle, department, and some numeric codes.
